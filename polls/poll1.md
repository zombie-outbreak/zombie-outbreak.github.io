# Community Poll 1
A while ago I sent out a poll for the community to fill in. After some time and a few responses I have recently been able to go through the results and I will now talk about them and how I will act on the results.

## Question 1
The first public test will be contained to the Bayside area, are you okay with this?* 

*This includes up to the Bayside tunnel and the bridge to San Fierro.

| Yes | No | Other |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 77% | 0% | 23% |

### Other Responses
| Response |
| ------ |
| Bayside and El Q |
| I prefer other areas but it doesn't really matter this much |

## Outcome
The first public test is purely to make sure the fundamental systems work before continuing with more development. The idea is to have most of the core features in place and then to test them with other players in a small area. The initial test versions will not be canon to the server story and wipes will happen at the end of the public test phase.

So why ask this question? I wanted to get the general feeling around the idea of having a contained test area and also helps expectations not be too high for a public test version in terms of playable area. The whole of Las Venturas is planned for the main release, once core functionality is working.
